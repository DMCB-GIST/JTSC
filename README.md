# Joint triplet loss with semi-hard constraint for data augmentation and disease prediction using gene expression data

The joint triplet loss model with a semi-hard constraint (JTSC) is designed to represent data with a small number of samples. JTSC uses a strict selection process for semi-hard samples to construct triplets, combined with an angular loss function to achieve better prediction results in the tasks.
